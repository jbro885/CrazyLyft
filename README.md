Inspired by Crazy Taxi and Pac Man, The Driving Dead is a browser game in which the user, driving a taxi, has to rush to collect(run over) as many passengers (zombies) as possible. This is a single page application, entirely written with Javascript. Users and scores are saved to a Rails backend [here](https://github.com/jarretbryan/crazyLyft-backend) which provides the API to manage user data and scores.

The HTML is styled with modified bootstrap, and the game itself uses the HTML5 Canvas, with JS providing the functionality.
